# randomActs-Bulma
This repo is just used for me to test out/practice using the Bulma framework. I was using Bulma to mirror the work my group had done for our charity finder app, 
which can be found in my other repo: random_Acts_Of_Kindess. As it turns out, Bulma is great! It's really user-friendly, easy to learn, and intuitive. I have 
transferred the files created here to our other repo, and we will continue to use Bulma for our group project. I still want to continue using Bulma. I never quite 
got my carousel up and working, so I may come back here in the future (probably when Bootcamp is over) and play around some more.
